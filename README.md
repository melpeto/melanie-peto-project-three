# Custom Poll Creator

Enter a question and two possible responses, and have users cast their votes! This app uses React components, state, routes, and props, and connects to Firebase for persistent data.

## Next Steps

- To make this a real-world usable app, of course users should only be able to vote once. I would like to further explore some ways to allow one-time-only voting per user, for example cookies, user authentication/registration, email with unique link using GUID, etc. Of course these simple ways could be overridden by a savvy user but I think they would be a great place to start.
