# Custom Poll Creator

Enter a question and two possible responses, and have users cast their votes! This app uses React components, state, routes, and props, and connects to Firebase for persistent data.

## Next Steps

- To make this a real-world usable app, of course users should only be able to vote once. I would like to further explore some ways to allow one-time-only voting per user, for example, local storage, cookies, user authentication/registration, email with unique link using GUID, etc. 
- I will likely begin with using local storage to determine whether or not a user has voted on a particular poll. Of course this could be overridden by a savvy user but I think it would be a great place to start!
